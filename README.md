# 3D-graph-explorer
A tool to explore a graph in 3D created with three.js

## About
This project was a way to learn about three.js through implementing a force-directed-graph algorithm in 3d and let you explore the resulting graph. 

## Force-directed-graph
The force-directed-graph algorithm uses a simple set of rules to move each node. All nodes repell each other similar to electric repulsion.
Nodes connected to each other attract similar to a spring force. Lastly all nodes are weakly attracted to the center similar to a gravitational force.
